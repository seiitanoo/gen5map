Contributing
- Huge thank you to #Brin7853 For helping me figure out how to properly map these areas. Thank you to [GuyPerfect](https://www.vgmaps.com/forums/index.php?topic=1954.0) as well. Without the custom emulator he modified, this project would not be possible.
- All Pokemon Sprites were scraped from [Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/sprites/) So thank you to their hard work!
- All Item sprites were scraped and downloaded from [poke-sprite](https://msikma.github.io/pokesprite/) their github is [here](https://github.com/msikma/pokesprite). Special thank you to them as well.
- Item Locations come from [pdwit's](https://imgur.com/gallery/black-white-2-hidden-items-tms-hms-YOahEnN) hidden items and tms list, In addition to [this](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Walkthrough:Pok%C3%A9mon_Black_2_and_White_2) walkthrough from Bulbapedia.
- Bridge Maps, White forrest, and Black City come from the BW1/BW2 Variants of them from [Idkdkak](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/wiki/User_talk:Idkdkak), Without him, those maps would not be a thing.
- And Finally thank you to My Co-worker's and my friend seiitanoo, without them this project wouldn't exist.
