an w.i.p interactive map of the Unova region!

Interactive Maps for gen 1,3 and 4 have already been created, its time to add the 5th generation!


Things that are planned So far:
- implement a better encounter table (Than the previous interactive maps)
- be able to view information about npcs (redirect to [bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/) or [serebii](https://www.serebii.net/))
- item locations
- alternate black/white rooms
- seasons!! (later date)

Contributing
- Huge thank you to #Brin7853 For helping me figure out how to do this. Thank you to [GuyPerfect](https://www.vgmaps.com/forums/index.php?topic=1954.0) as well. Without the custom emulator he created, this project would not be possible.
